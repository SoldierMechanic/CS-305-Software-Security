# CS-305-Software-Security
For this assignment, I chose to submit the Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report to my GitHub portfolio. This project provided valuable experience in real-world security assessment and implementation. Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their clients, including retirement planning, investments, and insurance. They approached us needing to modernize their operations with a focus on secure communications, particularly for their RESTful web API that handles sensitive financial data.

One aspect I handled particularly well was conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment that uncovered several critical security issues. Through both manual code review and automated dependency checking, I identified vulnerabilities including unsecured database connections, weak session management, and multiple outdated dependencies with known CVEs. This experience reinforced why secure coding is crucial - in financial services, a single security breach could be catastrophic, potentially exposing sensitive client data and damaging the company's reputation irreparably.

The most challenging yet enlightening part of the vulnerability assessment was prioritizing the numerous security issues discovered. It required balancing the severity of vulnerabilities against implementation complexity and potential business impact. I found the static analysis particularly helpful, as it revealed several dependency vulnerabilities I might have missed through manual review alone.

To enhance security, I implemented multiple layers of protection including HTTPS with TLS 1.3, input validation across all entry points, and proper error handling. Looking ahead, I would expand my security toolkit to include dynamic analysis tools and threat modeling frameworks to make more informed decisions about mitigation strategies.

To verify the security and functionality of my implementation, I conducted thorough testing after each refactoring phase. This included running updated dependency checks, performing penetration testing, and validating that all security controls were functioning as intended without introducing new vulnerabilities or breaking existing functionality.

The most valuable resources I utilized were the OWASP Top 10, Spring Security documentation, and various static analysis tools. These will definitely be part of my security toolkit for future projects. For potential employers, this project demonstrates my ability to conduct thorough security assessments, implement proper security controls, and maintain secure coding practices while working with modern frameworks and tools in a financial services context.

Looking back, this assignment provided practical experience in securing real-world applications and reinforced the importance of maintaining multiple layers of security in financial software systems. The skills and knowledge gained here will be invaluable for future security-focused development work.
